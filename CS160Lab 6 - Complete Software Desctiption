    After six grueling weeks, the menu order interface has been completed! I took the liberty
of implementing a functional GUI that will complement the menu ordering system. With the
barebones of the program, the menu ordering system functions as you have asked, but I figured
that customers would want to know what they're ordering. That's where Images.java comes in.
This class provides a crucial visual component to the ordering process, enhancing the overall
user experience and satisfaction.
    The inclusion of the GUI in Images.java is a valuable addition to the menu ordering
system for several reasons. First and foremost, it offers a visually appealing representation of the
available drinks and their corresponding prices. Customers are more likely to engage with a
menu that provides visual cues, as it helps them make informed decisions about their selections.
By incorporating images of the various coffee options, such as black coffee and espresso,
alongside their respective price information, the GUI empowers customers to make choices
based on their preferences and budget.
    Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the GUI in Images.java greatly enhances usability.
The images and labels are updated in real time as the user navigates through the menu options.
When a new coffee is created, the GUI automatically refreshes to display the updated images and
prices. Similarly, when the user enters the decorator menu, the GUI adjusts accordingly to show
the available options, such as hot water, milk, sugar, whipped cream, and flavored syrups, with
their respective prices. This seamless integration ensures that customers have the most up-to-date
and accurate information throughout their ordering journey.
